Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I'd
Like to say to you, but I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I'd
Like to say to you, but I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me that saves me

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger!
I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please, don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock'n'roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger!
I heard you say

So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger!
I heard you say

So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger!
Don't look back in anger!
I heard you say

At least not today

Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone

May your smile may your smile
Shine on shine on
Don't be scared don't be scared
Your destiny may keep you warm

Cause all of the stars
Are fadin' away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop cryin' your heart out

Get up get up
Come on come on
Why you scared? Im not scared
You'll never change whats been and gone

Cause all of the stars
Are fadin' away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop cryin' your heart out

Cause all of the stars
Are fadin' away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop cryin' your heart out

Were all of us stars
Were fadin away
Just try not to worry
You'll see us some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop cryin' your heart out

Stop cryin your heart out
Stop cryin your heart out
Stop cryin your heart out

Cold and frosty morning, theres not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day was dawning my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind

I don't want to be there when you're coming down
I don't want to be there when you hit the ground

So dont go away
Say what you say
But say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education I can't find the words to say
About the things caught in my mind

I don't want to be there when you're coming down
I don't want to be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away
Say what you say
But say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Me and you what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong

So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

So don't go away
Say what you say
But say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
Cause I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

Cause I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

So don't go away

Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know?
They only seem to come and go away

Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe
In the things we find behind the door

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know?
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be

Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows
The way it's gonna be

If you're leaving, will you take me with you?
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I could never give you
My heart will never be your home

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know?
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be

Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows
Yea nobody knows
The way it's gonna be

The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah

Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know?
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be

Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows
Yeah, God only knows
The way it's gonna be

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows cos I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain?
In the morning rain as it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I just want to fly I want to live I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breathe maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me we see things they'll never see
You and I were gonna live forever

I said maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows cos I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain?
In the morning rain as it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I will never be all the things that I want to be
But now is not the time to cry now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me we see things they'll never see
You and I we're gonna live forever

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows cos I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain?
In the morning rain as it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I just want to fly I want to live I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breathe maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me we see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever

Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all, but
How much do you want it?

You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you
In your BMW?
You can sail with me
In my yellow submarine

You need to find out
Cause no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way
For what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka-Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane
On a supersonic train

And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with the doctor
On a helicopter
She's sniffin' in a tissue
Sellin' The Big Issue

And she finds out
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way
For what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

I would like to leave this city
This old town don't smell too pretty and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind
And when I leave this island
I'll book myself into a soul asylum
Cause I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

So here I go
Still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
Half the world away
Half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down

And when I leave this planet
Y'know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind
And if I could leave this spirit
I'd find me a hole and I'll live in it and
I can feel the warning signs
Running around my mind

So here I go
I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway
Half the world away
Half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down

No I don't feel down
No I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down
I don't feel down

Take the time to make some sense
Of what you want to say
And cast your words away upon the waves
Sail them home with acquiesce
On a ship of hope today
And as they land upon the shore
Tell them not to fear no more
Say it loud and sing it proud today

And then dance if you want to dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand
Won't make us understand
We're all part of the masterplan

Say it loud and sing it proud today

I'm not saying right is wrong
It's up to us to make
The best of all the things that come our way
Coz everything that's been has past
The answer's in the looking glass
There's four and twenty million doors
On life's endless corridor
Say it loud and sing it proud and they

Will dance if they want to dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't know
How it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand
Won't make you understand
We're all part of the masterplan

We the people fight for our existence
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance
Fadin' like the stars we wish to be

You know I didn't mean
What I just said
But my god woke up on the wrong side of his bed
And it just don't matter now

'Cause little by little
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little
You have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just asked myself why, are you really here?

True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that sounds foolish but it's true
The day has come and now you'll have to accept
The life inside your head we give to you

You know I didn't mean
What I just said
But my god woke up on the wrong side of his bed
And it just don't matter now

Cause little by little
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little
You have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why are you really here?

Hey!

Little by little
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little you have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why you really here?
Why am I really here?
Why am I really here?

Who kicked a hole in the sky
So the heavens would cry over me?
Who stole the soul from the sun
In a world come undone at the seams?

Let there be love
Let there be love

I hope the weather is calm
As you sail up your heavenly stream
Suspended clear in the sky
Are the words that we sing in our dreams

Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

Come on, baby blue
Shake up your tired eyes
The world is waiting for you
May all your dreaming fill the empty sky
But if it makes you happy
Keep on clapping
Just remember I'll be by your side
And if you don't let go
It's going to pass you by

Who kicked a hole in the sky
So the heavens would cry over me?
Who stole the soul from the sun
In a world come undone at the seams?

Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

Summer sun that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known

A dying scream makes no sound
Calling out to all that I've ever known
Here am I, lost and found
Calling out to all

We live a dying dream
If you know what I mean
All that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known

Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cry the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
Called him up in-and-out of nowhere
Said "if you won't save me, please, don't waste my time"

Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
I cry the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
Called him up in-and-out of nowhere
Said "if you won't save me, please, don't waste my time"

Summer sun that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known
